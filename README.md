Supr Smpl Responsive CSS Grid


Achieving a nice 12-Column responsive grid system really is super simple.

This css applies a fluid, percentage-based, grid to all displays bigger than a mobile.

Grab the contents (or save) supr-smpl.css for use in your project.

**If you’re looking to quickly use this in a tumblr theme, drop the following code into your ```<head>```.**

```<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”http://static.tumblr.com/o3mi8ie/tfln673lo/supr-smpl.css”>```

**To use the grid, apply the basic classes needed for your layout:**

```.sixcol = 50%, .threecol = 25%, .ninecol = 75% etc.```

**Then define the position:**

```.first will stick a grid item to the left, .last to the right.```
(*Only apply to the first/last items on each row.*)

```.centercol will…., well, you get the idea at this point.```

```.clearfix works it's obvious magic too```
